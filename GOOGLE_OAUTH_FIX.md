# üîß Fix Google OAuth Redirect URI Mismatch

## Error
```
Error 400: redirect_uri_mismatch
```

This means the redirect URI in Google Cloud Console doesn't match your Netlify URL.

---

## Quick Fix Steps

### 1. Go to Google Cloud Console
Visit: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

### 2. Find Your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
- Look for the client ID that starts with: `804354755189-...`
- Click on it to edit

### 3. Add These EXACT Redirect URIs

**CRITICAL:** Add these exact URIs (copy-paste to avoid typos):

```
https://soulmusicfest.netlify.app/api/auth/callback/google
```

**Also keep your localhost URI for development:**
```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
```

### 4. Authorized JavaScript Origins

Also add these to **Authorized JavaScript origins**:
```
https://soulmusicfest.netlify.app
http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Save Changes
- Click **SAVE** at the bottom
- Wait 1-2 minutes for changes to propagate

### 6. Test Again
- Clear your browser cache/cookies OR use incognito mode
- Go to: https://soulmusicfest.netlify.app
- Try signing in with Google

## Visual Guide

Your Google OAuth Console should look like this:

**Authorized redirect URIs:**
```
‚úÖ http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/google
‚úÖ https://soulmusicfest.netlify.app/api/auth/callback/google
```

**Authorized JavaScript origins:**
```
‚úÖ http://localhost:3000
‚úÖ https://soulmusicfest.netlify.app
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Wrong:** `https://soulmusicfest.netlify.app/auth/callback/google`
‚úÖ **Correct:** `https://soulmusicfest.netlify.app/api/auth/callback/google`

‚ùå **Wrong:** Adding trailing slash: `https://soulmusicfest.netlify.app/`
‚úÖ **Correct:** No trailing slash: `https://soulmusicfest.netlify.app`

‚ùå **Wrong:** Using HTTP instead of HTTPS for production
‚úÖ **Correct:** Always use HTTPS for Netlify URLs

## Still Not Working?

### Check 1: Verify Environment Variables in Netlify
Go to Netlify Dashboard ‚Üí Site settings ‚Üí Environment variables

Confirm these are set:
```
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://soulmusicfest.netlify.app
AUTH_TRUST_HOST=true
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=<your-google-client-id>
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-google-client-secret>
```

### Check 2: Clear Browser Cache
- Open incognito/private window
- Or clear all cookies for soulmusicfest.netlify.app

### Check 3: Wait for Google Changes
- Google OAuth changes can take 1-5 minutes to propagate
- Try again after a few minutes

### Check 4: Verify Latest Deploy
- Go to Netlify ‚Üí Deploys
- Confirm the latest deploy with `trustHost: true` is live
- Check deploy logs for any errors
