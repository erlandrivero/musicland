# Suno API Features Available on Starter Plan

## Important Discovery üîç

**Good News:** Based on the Suno API documentation, **ALL API endpoints are available regardless of your plan tier**. The main difference between plans is:

1. **Monthly Credit Allocation** - How many credits you get per month
2. **Rate Limits** - Concurrent requests and daily limits
3. **Support Level** - Response time and priority

**The API itself doesn't gate features by plan** - you can access ANY endpoint as long as you have credits!
