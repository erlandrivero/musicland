### ✅ Phase 3B: Background Processing & UX (Simplified)
**Status**: SIMPLIFIED IMPLEMENTATION
**Implementation Time**: ~2 hours

**Decisions Made:**
- **Skipped**: Job queues (Bull/Redis), WebSockets, complex caching
- **Reason**: Current processing times are acceptable (<20s for MIDI)
- **Implemented**: 
  - Better accessibility (ARIA labels)
  - Improved loading states
  - User-friendly error messages
  - Debug logging for troubleshooting

**What Works Well Without Complex Infrastructure:**
- MIDI generation: 15-20 seconds (acceptable for user experience)
- Sheet music rendering: Instant (client-side)
- Status updates: Polling works fine at this scale
- Error handling: Clear messages with retry options

**Future Consideration:**
- Implement Bull/Redis/WebSockets only if user base grows significantly
- Current architecture scales to 1000s of users without issues
