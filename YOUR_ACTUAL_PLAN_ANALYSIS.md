**Why Implement:**
- Only 2 credits (vs 10 for full song)
- **Perfect pairing with your spell-check feature!**
- Test 5 different lyric ideas for the cost of 1 song
- Reduces wasted generations

**Credit Efficiency:**
- Current: User generates song with bad lyrics = 10 credits wasted
- With Lyrics Gen: Test lyrics for 2 credits, then generate = 12 credits total, but BETTER result
- **ROI: Higher quality outcomes**

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// API Endpoint: /api/v1/lyrics
POST https://api.aimusicapi.com/api/v1/lyrics
{
