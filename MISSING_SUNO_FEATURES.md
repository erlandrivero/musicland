## üöÄ High-Value Missing Features

### 1. **Extend/Continue Music** üî• HIGH PRIORITY
**API Endpoint:** `POST /api/v1/generate/extend`

**What It Does:**
- Extends existing songs beyond their original length
- Continues the song from a specific timestamp (e.g., 60 seconds)
- Maintains musical coherence and style
- Perfect for creating longer versions or adding sections

**Use Cases:**
- "Make this 30-second intro into a full 3-minute song"
- "Add another verse and chorus"
- "Extend the outro for 20 more seconds"
- Loop creation for background music

**Parameters:**
```typescript
{
  audioId: string;           // Existing track to extend
  prompt: string;            // How to extend
  continueAt: number;        // Timestamp in seconds
  style?: string;
  title?: string;
  model: ModelVersion;
}
```

**Business Value:**
- Users can iterate on songs they like without starting over
- Creates longer content without multiple generations
- Saves credits (extending is typically cheaper than new generation)

**Implementation Complexity:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Medium
- Need to store audioId from generated tracks
- Add "Extend" button to completed tracks
- New API endpoint and UI modal

      "word": "[Verse]\nWaggin'",
      "startS": 1.36,
      "endS": 1.79
    }
  ],
  "waveformData": [0, 1, 0.5, 0.75]
}
```
